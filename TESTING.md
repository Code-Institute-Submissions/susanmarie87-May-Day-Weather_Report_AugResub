## Code Validation

### W3C HTML Validator

All html written for the site was checked using the HTML Validator on [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/).

* **HTML Result:**

### W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator

The CSS was checked and upon the first passm two minor errors were returned. One error was from unnecessary code. Another error in the text-shadow values which was removed as the text-shadow did not add much to the site itself.

The CSS was then ran through again and passed all tests.
