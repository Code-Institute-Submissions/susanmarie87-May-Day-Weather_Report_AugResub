### **Design Choices**

<a></a>
#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.

I choose the style Quicksand for its subtlety. This font style is clean and legible leaving the user feeling comfortable while retrieving their information. 

Since the app itself is so simple and one page, I battled with the thought of adding several different types of font in order to break up any possible monotony but in the end I choose to keep it simple with a single font.

<a></a>
#### Colors

#474242d0 Is a translucent type of grey that has such a modern and sharp appeal that i choose it to for the card which will display the weather data that is received.

#f2f2f2 Is the color of the font for all of the Headings, texts, and input on the app. I have chosen to go with darker colrs and white as they are a classic match and will not be visually straining on the eyes. 

#3a3a3a Was chosen for the searchbar. This color closely resembled the same color as the bootstrap navbar and I wanted to keep the colors congruent throughout the page. I want the user to feel positive about their experience while proving easy readablitity and I found that the Quicksand font embodied all of these aspects quite nicely.

## **Features**
<a></a>
### **Existing Features**

#### Navigation
This app requires only a very basic navigation. Since there are no pages to navigate too there will only be two items displayed across the navbar but no actual links. 
The first thing to be displayed is the title of the weather app. 
The second thing to be displayed will be a toggle switch capable of taking the site into dark mode.

#### Hero Image

The Hero Image for this weather application is ever changing. Using a special link to unsplash, the hero image will consistently change anytime the page is refreshed. This makes having the weather data displayed on the card necessary as it impossible to see without a card.

#### How-To-Modal

The how-to-Modal button is located conveniently with the card. This is so users can easily see that there is more information in the event they are unable to figure out how to use the site on their own. When the modal button is clicked a how-to-modal body will then pop-up with directions as to how the app works. The modal will feature a close button for the user when they have finished reading the instructions.

#### Contact Form

A contact form adapted from [Coding Market- Form Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY4rvU4ImgE) was used to give users a place to send feedback in the event of errors with the site. 

<a></a>
### **Features to be implemented**
* Forecast weather
* Interactive map for location with a link to activities that are suitable for the days weather.
* A feature that could display the city for which the weather data is being displayed.
* A feature that could change the backgroud image to match the current weather conditions i.e. rainy weather = rainy background.
* Data on the safety of road conditions.

## **Testing**

## Code Validation

### W3C HTML Validator

All html written for the site was checked using the HTML Validator on [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/).

Multiple div errors were returned and fixed.

An aria-labelledby error was present so that was removed.

Two errors pertaining to the radio buttons about being duplicate classes as I had unecessary inline class elements that were originally for styling. These were removed and all the index.html code passed: 

[HTML PASS](assets/images/index-pass.png)



### W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator

The CSS was checked and upon the first pass two minor errors were returned. One error was from unnecessary code. Another error in the text-shadow values which was removed as the text-shadow did not add much to the site itself.

[CSS PASS](assets/images/css-pass.png)

### JSHint

All JavaScript was passed through JSHint Validator. Upon the initial test, A whopping 28 errors were returned. This problem was solved by adding the /*jshint esversion: 6 */ comment into the validator. 
After adding the comment, one unused variable: 'locationCityRef' was returned. This error was ignored.

## User Testing

### Browser Compatibility

**Note**: Responsiveness covers Desktop, Mobile and Tablet.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### Responsiveness Testing

The following breakpoints were tested using Chrome Dev Tools:

- **Desktop** - 1920px x 1080px
- **Tablet** - 768px x 1024px
- **Mobile** - 360px x 640px


* **Plan**    
Initially, the original background chosen had a type of May Day style theme behind it with tons of lightning igniting the sky. However, this picture and background theme was changed in the middle of the project. It was too harsh visually and the weather app called for something that would be slightly more impressive, which led me to find the CSS parallax background.

* **Implementation**   
. The CSS parallax background image was adapted from (https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-animated-background/) and implemented into the style.css file. 

* **Test**    
The background was tested on multiple screen sizes and devices all of which presented properly and did not return any errors. There was however an issue with visual appeal.
Due to the many colors in the background, it seemed as though all of the font colors would strain the eyes. 

* **Result**    
The visual problem was solved by removing the green trees in the background. This offset the clouds just enough so that the font did not get lost when it moved through the white backgroud. The green also impaired the font color presentation.

* **Verdict**

The background looked much better without the green trees behind the font but was still visually appealing to the user.

### Navigation bar

* **Plan**    
I want to include a navigation bar which will be fixed on top. 
The navigation should also be responsive when broken down to smaller screen sizes.
The title should be positioned in a way that it does not distract but fits in subtly in the background.

* **Implementation**   
I implemented the navigation bar using Bootstrap. This helps to give an overall structure and lay out to the navbar. 

* **Test**    
To test the navigation bar, I have click all the links to make sure it works properly. 
I have also opened the website in various browers (safari, google chrome, mozilla firefox) to make sure it works on all browsers and devices.

* **Result**    
The navigation bar shows nicely like expected on all browsers and devices. 


* **Verdict**    
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### Modal
* **Plan**    
I want to implement a modal which will open up when you click on 'How To Get Started'. 

* **Implementation**    
Using Bootstrap, I was able to get a code snippet for a Modal and implement it onto the card body where the user will be able to easily identify the button in the event that they need help figuring out how to operate the site.

* **Test**    
I have tested the modal on various devices and browsers. 
The modal was nicely centered and feels in line with the overall website. 

* **Result**    
The modal opened up when the correct button was clicked and appeared centered on the screen.

* **Verdict**    
The modal works as planned and met all the criteria. 


### Search Bar
* **Plan**    
I want to include a search bar where the user can easily identify that this is the first step in retrieving their weather data. The search bar should be visually appealing as well as functional. When the location information is entered into the search bar accurate data needs to be passed back into the card. 

* **Implementation**    
In order to implement this, an event listener was set on the search box for the key value 13 which is the enter button. Thiere will then be a fetch request ran. 

* **Test**    
The first three weeks of this project were a nightmare. I could not figure out why nothing I was doing was working. As it turns out, hidden in my api key was a - symbol instead of a + symbol. To this day I still do not know what that means. It has created within me a trauma response to javascript and code in general. This very minor but horrific detail was solved by my mentor, Simen Daehlin. 

* **Result**    
Upon changing the syntax, the functionality of the search bar was finally brought to life and all was right again in the world. .

* **Verdict**    
The search bar meets proper functionality.

### Bugs
The first bug that took years off of my life and made me doubt my entire existence, was merely a dash that should have been and equal sign. This minor error was detrimental to my time and was discovered with the help of my mentor, Sime Daehlin. 

The second bug that was discovered were simple misspelling in the const functions. The first two were missing the TEXT portion of inner.Text. The last error of the consts were 

#### Parallax Background

* **Bug**    
One of the original plans was to go with a parallax background for the weather app. The background looked beautiful but there were several issues. The first issue being that no matter what color was used, the data would be overpowered multiple times with the passing of the trees and the clouds. Not a single font seemed to look good against the back of the parallax background.

The second major issues with the parallax background was the enormous amount of CPU's that it was using to give the parallax effect. This excessive amount would kill a battery quick leaving the user with a bad experience when using the app.

* **Fix**    
The background was changed to a theme from unsplash where a new image is chosen every time. A card with a dark background color and white font was placed in the center that will reveal the data information upon a search.  

* **Verdict** 
Upon changing the parallax background and adding a card the site looked much more visually appealing and was no longer a strain on the eyes. 

#### JSHint Validator

* **Bug**    
When JavaScript portion was put through JSHint, 28 warnings came back. After some research on stackoverflow, I found that because I used ECMAScript 6, I needed to set an option letting JShint know that my code uses that specific syntax in order to avoid unecesssary warnings. 

* **Fix**        
I implemented the comment: /*jshint esversion: 6 */ - into jshint and only two warnings returned. Both missing semicolons. Line 38 and line 105. 

* **Verdict**    
The semi-colon was added in, the code was run through again and there were no errors returned after this.

#### Hero Image

* **Bug**    
The hero image is having some major issues. On large screens, the images are repeating. I thought I could fix this by adding in background-repeat: no-repeat; which did take care of the image repeating issue but then created a very large blank gap between the search bar and the side. 

* **Fix**    
 This problem was solved by looking into the url from unsplashes unique random picture generator. In the link, there was a specified screen-size that I was overlooking. This isssue was solved by simply changing the size in the url to better fit larger screen sizes.

* **Verdict**    

Double checking url links for pre-determined sizing is imperative.

#### TypeError in Promise

* **Bug**    
In the event the user makes a mistake and inputs incorrect information into the search bar an automatic error is thrown. Unfortunately it does not go away with just the click of the button and continuously repeats and the page must be refreshed. Since this creates a poor user experience, the problem must be resolved.


* **Fix** 
Two things were done in order to solve this problem. First, the blur event was removed. The blur event was in place so that anytime a space outside of the search-box was clicked, the user would receive an error. This type of situation can cause frustration for users which will make them leave the site. 
The second problem was multi-faceted and in order to solve this the placement of the .then statement was switched and  the parameters were changed. The first error was that the .then statement was placed under the catch error which is incorrect and will constantly send the function searching for the city. Moving the statement above the catch error lets the server know to catch the error.
Also, the parameters were wrong. I was passing showWeatherResults which was only grabbing data from the html and nothing about the actual location data. To solve this, weatherData was passed through instead and this grabbed specific data.

### Unresolved Issues

<a></a>

### iPad Pro and Large Screens

* **Bug**
On iPad Pro screens and other large screen sizes, the image beings to repeat again.


### Searchbar Placeholder Text

On very small screens like the Galaxy Fold, the placeholder text in the searchbar overlaps the screen.
