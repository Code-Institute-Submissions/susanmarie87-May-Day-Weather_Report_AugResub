### **Design Choices**

<a></a>
#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.

<a></a>
#### Icons

<a></a>
#### Colors
Initially, the original background chosen had a type of May Day style theme behind it with tons of lightning igniting the sky. Getting into the project though, the weather app needed 
a bit of a kick, so the style was completely hanged. A CSS parallax background was added as the motion gives the weather app a nice touch versus being mundane with a simple background image.
