### **Design Choices**

<a></a>
#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.

<a></a>
#### Colors

#ffff80 - The primary color used for this project is a medium type yellow that stands outs against the naturesque background. It also blended nicely and was not overpowering. This color looks to be the perfect fic against the parallax background.

The background image represents the color scheme consisting mainly of green, a light gray, brown mountains and black giving which shows forest imagery. 

The color chosen for the font was: #ffff80 which is a soft yellow to stand out against the parallax background. The font color needs to be specific against this images as it will pass through many different shades. #ffff80 seemed to be the best fit as it was the least straining on the eyes.

## **Testing**
Testing can be viewed at [TESTING.md](https://github.com/susanmarie87/may-day-weather-report/TESTING.md)

* **Plan**    
Initially, the original background chosen had a type of May Day style theme behind it with tons of lightning igniting the sky. However, this picture and background theme was changed in the middle of the project. It was too harsh visually and the weather app called for something that would be slightly more impressive, which led me to find the CSS parallax background.

* **Implementation**   
. The CSS parallax background image was adapted from (https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-animated-background/) and implemented into the style.css file. 

* **Test**    
The background was tested on multiple screen sizes and devices all of which presented properly and did not return any errors. There was however an issue with visual appeal.
Due to the many colors in the background, it seemed as though all of the font colors would strain the eyes. 

* **Result**    
The visual problem was solved by removing the green trees in the background. This offset the clouds just enough so that the font did not get lost when it moved through the white backgroud. The green also impaired the font color presentation.
* **Verdict**    
The background looked much better without the green trees behind the font but was still visually appealing to the user.

* **Plan**   
The weather app needs to have a search box function where a user can input the location information and the app will return the exact data of the desired location. 

* **Implementation**    
Several methods were used in order to get this function to work properly. First, the header and input type for the search box was set in index.html. Next, the search box was styled in CSS. Finally, the JavaScript const searchbox function was added into the scripts.js file.
* **Test**    
The searchbox function returns locations. 
* **Result**    
 The search box function returned the locations but it was not giving an error alert if the spelling was incorrect or if the location was unknown. 
* **Verdict**    
While the searchbox returned the weather location information properly, it did not have an error function which is necessary in the event of grammatical errors or unknown location.
* **Plan**    
The weather app will have a feature that returns the high and low temperatures of the location. 
* **Implementation**    
This was accomplished by 
* **Test**    

* **Result**    

* **Verdict**

### Bugs
The first bug that took years off of my life and made me doubt my entire existence, was merely a dash that should have been and equal sign. This minor error was detrimental to my time and was discovered with the help of my mentor, Sime DAehlin. 

The second bug that was discovered were simple misspelling in the const functions. The first two were missing the TEXT portion of inner.Text. The last error of the consts were
